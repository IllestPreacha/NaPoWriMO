poem:

Prompt #6: Nothing is But What is Not.

What is Nothing

Nothing is What

prompt #  6 is nothing is but what is not

a ton ? a thing? is this not thin ?

thing as the thaw-ing of the hat ?

hat that is not part of the prompt

buy may rise into a what

what is this? or what is that

But what if? Nothing is Everything

and everything has a reason to be

a reason to breathe but what then?

but what now?

can it be something that is seen beyond 6?

beyond six?

six or 6, but what is not?

notiswhat?

butwhat?

notiswhat whatisnothing

nothing that is flaunting

flaunting beyond the scope of this hint

hint as the props are similar to a tub and a mop

just there to stop

the rot of the pot that might be in the tub due to the mop as the prop of dirt leaves a 

stain

a stain that rains as if it was a pro

pro cold

pro this pro that
