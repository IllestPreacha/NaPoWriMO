Chorus: Food and Road Trip
Rite in Rolls Starting Lines : W W J D B R

Waking up to the smell of food
Would I grill or use the smoke of wood
Jalapenos for flavour
Delicious appetisers for Dinner 
Be Careful of the bugs as this road trip
Roars loud as we enter the other side of the flip

Rite in Rolls Starting Lines : Q A E D P L G N
Topic: Numbers , Colours, Numbers


Questioning if the kilometres are right
Alienating thoughts as the yellow on the humus is so tight
Entering the mouth, why is this yellow quite bright
Determining  the aspects of the recipes may have been a millilitre 
Precisely, 7 millimetres off
Locating what others source of food we brought
Guessing this first part of the trip, is more than we thought
Numbing thoughts as it was numbers, we didn't realise had to be fought

Waking up to the smell of food
Would I grill or use the smoke of wood
Jalapenos for flavour
Delicious appetisers for Dinner 
Be Careful of the bugs as this road trip
Roars loud as we enter the other side of the flip

Rite in Rolls Topics:  Mountain and Art
Rite in Rolls Starting Lines : C I E S F

Cruising through the terrain as if it was no one business
Interacting with nature as this is what the forest used as its canvas
Echoing sounds as we are blitzing away
Savouring of course occurs as the scenery has made our senses play
Flowers emerging, left and right as the sun calls it a day



Waking up to the smell of food
Would I grill or use the smoke of wood
Jalapenos for flavour
Delicious appetisers for Dinner 
Be Careful of the bugs as this road trip
Roars loud as we enter the other side of the flip
